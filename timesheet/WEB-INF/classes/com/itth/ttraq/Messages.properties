# hintful messages that application made a decision on its own
hint.viewuser.changed={0} is not assigned to {2}. Now viewing {1} instead.
hint.project.changed=Project {0} has no users assigned. Now viewing project {1} instead.
hint.assignment=The assignment associates a user with a project. Users can be only assigned to "topprojects", they are always assigned to the subprojects then. If a user is manager of a project he will receive all notification emails regarding this project and can approve (change the status of a timestamp).
hint.status=The status of a timestamp marks it. We advice to use status codes like "Approved", "Declined" and "Deducted". For the overview a color for the status can be set. Note: Beneath these status codes, timestamps can have a status of open. This means the end time was not entered yet. Open timestamps are always marked light red in the overview.
hint.type=The type of a timestamp can be used to differ in categories of timestamps eg: "Work time", "Travel time", "Single expense", "Information", "Note". The root concept of a timestamp is a slice of working time of course, but it can also used for other kinds of doings regarding a project. The default hourly rate gives a rough possibility to enter a wage, which helps to calculate an price if you selected the "Time based clearing".
